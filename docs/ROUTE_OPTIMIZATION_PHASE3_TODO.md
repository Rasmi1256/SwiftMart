# Route Optimization Phase 3 Implementation TODO

## Phase 3: Real-Time (Dynamic Rerouting, Weather Integration, Predictive Congestion)

### AI/ML Integration

- [ ] Implement GraphHopper for advanced routing with live traffic
- [ ] Add predictive congestion modeling using historical + live data
- [ ] Integrate weather APIs for precipitation/wind impact on routing
- [ ] Create ML models for route optimization scoring functions
- [ ] Implement reinforcement learning for continuous optimization

### Dynamic Optimization

- [ ] Add real-time rerouting based on traffic/weather events
- [ ] Implement predictive maintenance integration for vehicle routing
- [ ] Create route optimization API for mobile driver apps
- [ ] Add crowd-sourced traffic data integration
- [ ] Implement route optimization for electric vehicles (range optimization)

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Add multi-modal routing (bike/walking for last-mile)
- [ ] Implement route optimization for special deliveries (cold-chain, hazardous)
- [ ] Create route analytics dashboard for performance monitoring
- [ ] Add carbon footprint optimization for sustainable routing
- [ ] Implement route pooling for shared economy deliveries

### Real-Time Infrastructure

- [ ] Add GraphHopper service integration
- [ ] Implement real-time traffic data streaming
- [ ] Create predictive analytics service
- [ ] Add mobile app API endpoints
- [ ] Implement event-driven rerouting system

### Database Extensions

- [ ] Add real-time metrics tables for performance analytics
- [ ] Create carbon emission tracking models
- [ ] Add multi-modal routing data structures
- [ ] Implement predictive model storage
- [ ] Add crowd-sourced data validation schemas
